# =============================================================================
# Workflow: Release VSCode Manual
# =============================================================================
#
# Purpose:
#   Manual workflow for publishing VSCode extension with full test coverage.
#   Runs tests before publishing to the marketplace.
#   Uses WASM SQLite (cross-platform, no native dependencies).
#
# Triggers:
#   - workflow_dispatch (manual via GitHub UI or gh CLI)
#
# Inputs:
#   - release_type: dev, beta, or release (default: dev)
#
# Jobs:
#   - build-wasm: Build WASM module (required for core package)
#   - test-npm: Runs E2E tests for core package
#   - test-vscode: Runs VSCode extension tests on all platforms
#   - build: Builds and packages the extension
#   - publish: Publishes to VSCode Marketplace
#
# Outputs:
#   - VSCode extension published to marketplace
#   - Git tag created (release only)
#   - GitHub release created (release only)
#
# Related Workflows:
#   - tests-vscode.yml: VSCode extension tests without publishing
#   - ci-dev-release.yml: Auto-publish pre-release versions
