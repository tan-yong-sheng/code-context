# =============================================================================
# Workflow: Release on Tag
# =============================================================================
#
# Purpose:
#   Automated release workflow triggered by git tag pushes.
#   Publishes npm packages when a version tag (v* or c*) is pushed.
#   Uses WASM SQLite (cross-platform, no native dependencies).
#
# Triggers:
#   - push of tags matching 'v*' or 'c*'
#
# Jobs:
#   - build-wasm: Build WASM module (required for core package)
#   - release: Builds and publishes core + MCP packages to npm
#
# Outputs:
#   - npm packages published to registry
#
# Note:
#   This workflow does NOT run tests before publishing.
#   Use for quick releases after tests have passed in CI.
#
# Related Workflows:
#   - release-npm-manual.yml: Manual releases with test gates
#   - ci-dev-release.yml: Auto-publish dev versions
