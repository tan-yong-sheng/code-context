# =============================================================================
# Workflow: CI Dev Release
# =============================================================================
#
# Purpose:
#   Combined CI and auto-release workflow for development versions.
#   Runs tests and automatically publishes dev versions when on dev branch
#   or when manually triggered with publish=true.
#
# Triggers:
#   - push to master/main/dev branches
#   - pull_request to master/main branches
#   - workflow_dispatch with optional publish input
#
# Jobs:
#   - build-wasm: Build WASM module (required for core package)
#   - test: Runs tests on Node 20.x and 22.x
#   - publish-npm-dev: Auto-publishes npm dev versions (dev branch or manual)
#   - publish-vscode-prerelease: Auto-publishes VSCode pre-release versions
#
# Outputs:
#   - npm dev version published to registry
#   - VSCode pre-release extension published to marketplace
#
# Related Workflows:
#   - tests.yml: Primary CI without publishing
#   - release-npm-manual.yml: Manual npm releases
#   - release-vscode-manual.yml: Manual VSCode releases
